# Platform041
Repository containing information for the semestral project (NPRG041).

## Game overview (draft)
- 2D platform game written in C++
- uses some 2D library (like SFML)
- contains 1 or more levels to complete
- level consists of a world (possibly defined in some configuration file) containing some obstacles, collectibles and enemies (again defined in some external file)
- player's goal is to move the character to the end of the level without dying to enemies, fire/lava, falling out of the bounds...
- player may collect some collectibles (most likely coins) which will define the end score, not required to collect them though
- each level contains a timer which may be either a time limit, or simply a part of their statistics
- the game will be (hopefully) visually designed somehow nice
- optional extensions: personal statistics, level statistics, new levels, new types of enemies, ...
